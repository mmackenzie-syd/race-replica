# Race Replica


Race Replica is a website to test, develop and research single page applications built without one of the big Frameworks, such as React or Angular. It achieves this using the [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) template rendering library and a custom built router to navigate between pages.

Mustache itself, is descibed by its developers as a logic-less template syntax that can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

Other single page apps using Mustache template have been built before, for example there is one described by Michael Wanyoike in 2018 at sitepoint:
                [Single Page App Without a Framework](https://www.sitepoint.com/single-page-app-without-framework/).

There are a lot of client side routing libraries available, including [Vanilla Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-router), but I wanted to build my own with syntax based on the ExpressJS router and so the router used here is unique.
                
This website also features an algorithm to set a sequence of columns filled with text to be of identical heights. This gives the articles page of the website a magazine type of layout.

The styling was copied directly from an old version of the [Haute Hijab](https://www.hautehijab.com/) ecommerce website (2016). However, Haute Hijab has changed substantially over the years and there is now little resemblance to it.
